3. Most of the puzzles produced by the previous program are much too hard. Modify
the program so that it gives the user a threeletter
puzzle to start and then adjusts the
number of letters up by one every time a correct answer is given and down by one for
every wrong answer. In this way, the program will generally produce puzzles that are
at the userâ€™s level.

Rather than keeping all possible words in a single list, you should use a dictionary. If
the dictionary is called wordlists , then wordlists[7] should be a list of all words in
Pride and Prejudice that are seven letters long.
